# nhs-r_fomo_killer

An app to view tweets for the NHS-R conference 2019.

Inspired by a conversation about this application https://github.com/gadenbuie/tweet-conf-dash, but I didn't notice the code until after I'd finished the rough version.

Made in two hours on a train, so excuse the roughness.

PRs welcome! :-)
